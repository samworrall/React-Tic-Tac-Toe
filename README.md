# React Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a game of tic-tac-toe built by following the react tic-tac-toe tutorial with the intention of learning the basics of React.js, such as components, props, state, event handlers, and children.

This is a basic React tutorial and was not test driven. My aim is to learn the basics of Jest so that I could test drive the building of this same application myself.

### Instructions

Clone this repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:samworrall/React-Tic-Tac-Toe.git
```

Run the application
```
$ npm start
```
